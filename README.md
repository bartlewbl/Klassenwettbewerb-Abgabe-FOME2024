This application is a Flask-based web service designed to display sensor data from a PostgreSQL database, provide recommendations using a pre-trained machine learning model, and allow users to provide feedback on the model's predictions. Let's break down what each part of the code does:

Libraries Used:
Flask: For building the web application.
psycopg2: For connecting to PostgreSQL database.
joblib: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
yaml: For reading the database configuration from a YAML file.
plotly: For generating interactive plots.
Functions:
load_database_config(config_file): Loads database configuration from a YAML file.

get_latest_sensor_data(): Retrieves the latest sensor data from the PostgreSQL database.

generate_plot(data, x_label, y_label, plot_title): Generates a Plotly HTML plot from the sensor data.

Routes (Endpoints):
/ (index): Displays the latest sensor data and a recommendation based on the machine learning model's prediction.

/plots: Displays plots for temperature, humidity, CO2 level, and TVOC level based on the latest sensor data.

/feedback: Handles user feedback on the model's prediction accuracy.

Detailed Explanation:
The application connects to a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library and retrieves the latest sensor data from the "SensorData" table.
It then uses this data to make a prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model (model loaded via joblib).
The prediction result determines a recommendation message displayed on the home page (/ endpoint).
The /plots endpoint generates and displays interactive plots for temperature, humidity, CO2 level, and TVOC level.
The /feedback endpoint handles user feedback by updating the accuracy of the model based on the user's response.
File Structure:
databaseConfig.yaml: Contains database connection details (DBNAME, DBUSER, DBPASSWORD, DBHOST, DBPORT).
model.pkl: Pre-trained machine learning model.
templates directory: Contains HTML templates for rendering pages (index.html, plots.html, feedback.html).
Usage:
Make sure to install the required libraries (Flask, psycopg2, joblib, PyYAML, plotly) if not already installed.
Place the databaseConfig.yaml and model.pkl files in the specified directories.
Run the Flask application (python app.py) to start the web service.
This application demonstrates how to integrate Flask with a PostgreSQL database and a machine learning model to provide real-time recommendations and visualizations based on sensor data. It also shows how to handle user feedback to continuously improve the model's accuracy.
